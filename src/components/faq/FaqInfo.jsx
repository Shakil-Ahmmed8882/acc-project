          question: "How should I store my cigars?",
          answer:

          question: "What is the proper way to cut a cigar?",
          answer:
            "Use a sharp cigar cutter to remove the cap, making a clean cut just above the shoulder of the cigar. This ensures an even draw. A V-cutter and Punch are another option, up to the discretion of the smoker.",

        {
          question: "How do I light a cigar properly?",
          answer:
