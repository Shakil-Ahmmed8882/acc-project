## Installation

### Clone the Repository

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shakil-Ahmmed8882/acc-project.
```


## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following content. Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration:

```env
MONGODB_URL=".."
BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000/api/user"

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=""
BASE_URL_CLIENT="http://localhost:3000"

```


## Where to Find the Values

- **MONGODB_URL:** Go to your [MongoDB Atlas dashboard](https://cloud.mongodb.com/), navigate to the "Clusters" section, and click on "Connect" to get your connection string. Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your MongoDB credentials.

- **BASE_URL:** This should be the URL where your backend API is hosted. If you're running locally, this will be something like `http://localhost:3000/api/user`.

- **NEXTAUTH_URL:** This is the URL of your Next.js application. If you’re running locally, it’s `http://localhost:3000`.

- **NEXTAUTH_SECRET:** Generate a secure random string. You can use tools like [random.org](https://www.random.org/) or the `openssl` command-line tool for this purpose.

- **NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME:** Log in to your [Cloudinary account](https://cloudinary.com/) and find the Cloud Name in your account settings.

- **BASE_URL_CLIENT:** This should match the URL where your client application is hosted. If you're running locally, this will be `http://localhost:3000`.
